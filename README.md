National Treasures explores National Parks in the United States with a focus on the African-American Hertitage series. Users may get an overview of the parks' themes and utilize the dashboard to plan a trip. National Treasurers has a Ruby on Rails backend and a React frontend.

The application logic is contained in the controllers.
